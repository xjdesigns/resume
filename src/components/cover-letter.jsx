            I have worked across many areas of frontend work throught my career from web apps and website builders to node and AWS serverless. This has given me a lot knowledge in different environments and areas. One of the projects I am most proud of is the creation of Targets new point of sale application. Using my experience and knowledge I helped lead the project to deliver fast results during initial development but also supporting the team in learning the new technologies. This has given me much more condifidence when taking on new jobs, experiences, and giving mindful feedback on technology stacks to help create a strong development cycle.

            During the early part of the year I was apart of some company layoffs which did have benefits for me to take some time to mental reset while also working on personal projects. This allowed me to spend time learning new technologies that I see being added to industry standards but also working with previous stacks that I think have amazing use cases.
